# Chores: optional item/system targets

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-05-24

## Problem

Today `Reminder` and `Chore` share the `reminders` table, discriminated by `kind: REMINDER | CHORE`. Both require ≥1 `ReminderTarget` (an item or system link). Chores in practice are often standalone tasks ("take out the trash", "rotate the mattress") with no asset to point at, and forcing a fake link to satisfy validation distorts the data.

The proposal: **chores have 0..N item/system links; reminders still require ≥1.** This turns the "asset-link" convention into a schema rule and sharpens the kind distinction:

- **Reminder** — *this thing needs servicing on a cadence, notify me.* Asset-centric.
- **Chore** — *do this task on a cadence, I'll check the list myself.* Task-centric.

Notifications remain the only behavioral difference (reminders fire push/email via `reminders-tick`; chores never do). Digests intentionally include both — that asymmetry is deliberate and is preserved.

## Approach

### Standalone targets

A chore with zero links still gets exactly one `ReminderTarget` row, with both `itemId` and `systemId` NULL. The row holds `nextDueOn` / `lastCompletedOn` / completions exactly as today.

Why standalone-target rather than lifting schedule fields onto `Reminder`:
- Worker (`reminders-tick`), completion writes, calendar render, ICS feed, and `lib/reminders/queries.ts` all operate on `ReminderTarget`. Keeping the standalone row means none of those paths fork by kind.
- The `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` unique on `(reminderId, itemId, systemId)` already guarantees at most one standalone row per reminder.
- Trade-off: the DB allows a "target with no link" shape, which is conceptually a little odd. Mitigated by zod enforcing that standalone targets only appear under `kind=CHORE` reminders.

### Server-side reconciliation

The user submits a target list (possibly empty). The server reconciles to enforce the invariant "every chore has ≥1 target row":

- `kind=CHORE`, submitted targets has ≥1 link → no standalone row; delete any pre-existing standalone.
- `kind=CHORE`, submitted targets is empty → ensure exactly one standalone row exists (create if missing; preserve its `lastCompletedOn` / `nextDueOn` across edits).
- `kind=REMINDER`, submitted targets must be ≥1 (existing rule).

This makes the "0 links ↔ 1 standalone" mapping a server concern, invisible to the form.

## Changes

### Schema / migration

Relax the XOR CHECK on `reminder_targets`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "reminder_targets" DROP CONSTRAINT "reminder_targets_parent_xor";
ALTER TABLE "reminder_targets"
  ADD CONSTRAINT "reminder_targets_parent_at_most_one"
  CHECK (NOT ("itemId" IS NOT NULL AND "systemId" IS NOT NULL));
```

Reads as: "at most one of itemId/systemId may be set." Both-NULL becomes legal.

No data backfill — existing chores keep their links. The new shape is only available going forward.

The Prisma schema needs no model change; `itemId` / `systemId` are already `String?`. Per the [Prisma migration drift](memory:feedback_prisma_migration_drift) note, the migration is hand-written to swap the CHECK constraint without dropping the surrounding pgvector indexes.

### `lib/targets/schema.ts`

Split the validator:

- `remindersTargetsSchema = z.array(targetInputSchema).min(1, …)` — current behavior.
- `choresTargetsSchema = z.array(targetInputSchema).min(0)` — new.

Call sites pick the right one based on `kind`.

### `lib/reminders/schema.ts`

`createReminderSchema` / `updateReminderSchema` use a discriminated union on `kind`:

- `kind: 'REMINDER'` branch uses `remindersTargetsSchema`.
- `kind: 'CHORE'` branch uses `choresTargetsSchema`.

The "kind cannot silently flip on update" guard noted in the file's existing comment is preserved.

### Server action / route handler (create + update)

After zod parses, before the Prisma write:

```ts
const reconciledTargets =
  kind === 'CHORE' && parsedTargets.length === 0
    ? [{ itemId: null, systemId: null }]   // standalone
    : parsedTargets;
```

On update, if transitioning chore from "links" → "no links", delete the link rows and create a single standalone row; if "no links" → "links", delete the standalone row before inserting the new link rows. Preserve `lastCompletedOn` / `nextDueOn` from whichever row existed if there's only one (best-effort continuity for the chore's schedule).

### `components/reminders/ReminderForm.tsx`

- When `isChore`, drop the `targets.length === 0` error gate (lines around 100, 127).
- Label the picker "Linked items / systems (optional)" only when `isChore`.
- Keep the picker visible — per the "optional" UX choice, not "hidden."

### `components/targets/TargetsPicker.tsx`

No prop changes needed; it already renders fine with an empty list. Spot-check that the empty state copy doesn't read as an error.

### Read paths — verify, don't change

These all already left-join through `ReminderTarget` and tolerate individual NULLs:

- `lib/reminders/queries.ts` — chore listing.
- `components/calendar/MonthGrid.tsx` — verify a chore with no link renders as just the title.
- ICS feed (project_ics_completion_feed_status) — chore events without a link render with title only.
- `worker/jobs/reminders-tick.ts` — skips `kind=CHORE` entirely; unaffected.
- Dashboard activity / item-restored event paths — chores without targets don't surface item names, which is correct.

## Tests

Per [project_testing_strategy_status](memory:project_testing_strategy_status), tag the critical-path coverage `@critical`.

- `lib/reminders/schema.test.ts` — extend:
  - chore with 0 targets parses successfully.
  - reminder with 0 targets still rejected.
  - chore with mixed item + system targets parses.
- Server action / handler unit tests:
  - chore create with 0 user targets → 1 standalone row written.
  - chore update from 1 link → 0 links → standalone row created, link row deleted.
  - chore update from 0 links → 1 link → standalone row deleted, link row inserted.
  - reminder create with 0 targets still rejected.
- DB-level smoke test: insert a standalone `ReminderTarget` succeeds; insert with both `itemId` AND `systemId` set still rejected by the new CHECK.
- E2E (`@critical`): create a chore via the form with no link, complete it once, verify it reappears next cycle.

## Out of scope

- Backfilling existing linked chores into standalone shape (call: leave existing chores alone).
- Changing chore completion semantics — still per-target; standalone is its own target.
- Touching reminders' validation or UX.
- A cross-table Postgres trigger enforcing "standalone targets only under CHORE parents" — zod-only enforcement, accepting the residual risk that a direct SQL insert outside the app could create an invalid row.
- Collapsing `REMINDER` and `CHORE` into a single kind with a `notify` boolean — decided against; the mental split + existing kind-branching code make the boolean a net loss.

## Open questions

None — all design calls resolved during brainstorm:

- Picker UX: **optional**, not hidden.
- Existing data: **leave as-is**.
- Schedule home: **standalone target row**.
- Cross-table CHECK: **zod-only** enforcement.
